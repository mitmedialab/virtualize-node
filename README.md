# local-node-install
Utility package to assist in installing and using node local to a specific folder, kind of like a 'virtual environment' for node.

# How to get started
This package is intended to be added to an existing project that will/does utilize [node|https://nodejs.org/en/] (likely as one of the first things you do when setting up the project).

It is recommended to add this project as [git submodule|https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules]. Using git submodules is a little controversial, so please checkout the [Why install this package as a git submodule?|#why-install-this-package-as-a-git-submodule?] section to make sure the potential 'gotchas' don't worry you. If they do, simply download the contents of this repo and add it to your project folder structure.
